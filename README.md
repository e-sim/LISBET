# LISBET
### Language Interface System for a Better ELIZA-like Therapist
An upgrade to ELIZA using machine learning

Stages:
1. recreate ELIZA, add rules (current stage)
    Recreate ELIZA in Python, see if there are any rules that can easily make it better
    Upgrade dialogs for modern cognitive behavioral therapy
    
2. gather data
    Add ability to save script and rate the "humanness" and/or effectiveness of advice
    Get proto LISBET online or otherwise distributed to my social network
    Use this to gather as much data as possible
    
3. add new features (concurrent with step 2)
    Add ability to have different users w/ongoing records
    Add sentiment analysis --> mood tracking ability
    Maybe add a journalling feature too?  Or goal tracking?
    Have mood tracker make pretty graphs
    
4. the real LISBET
    Use TensorFlow (algorithm tbd) with data from stage 2 to make her awesome
    Integrate mood data with above?
    Collect more data to ensure she's actually significantly better
    
5. extra credit
    Collect actual (well, example) CBT scripts to include in training
    Create ontology of cognitive distortions & other CBT concepts
    Add classifier to suggest possible cognitive distortions present
